This is a modified rules file that my dad made for Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 - Yuri's Revenge, which I've made my own modifications to as well.

List of changes (as far as I know):
- SEALs don't alert other players when created
- Hovercrafts aren't immune to psi weapons
- Yuri's grinder gets nothing from certain vehicles like medium tanks or aircraft carriers
- Aegis cruisers are slightly faster
- Aircraft carriers have five planes instead of three
- Heavy tanks take slightly longer to build
- Tesla tanks take slightly longer to build
- Chaos drones are stronger, cost less, and take less time to build
- Harvesters cost less and take longer to build
- Soviet siege choppers cost more
- Soviet MIGs are weaker
- Spy planes are weaker
- Grand cannons can be built by anyone, cost less, are not immune to psi weapons, and are not drainable
- Nuclear reactors can be built by anyone, has no prerequisites, and cannot be drained
- Soviet ore refineries produce more cash on average
- Nuclear silos explode & produce radiation when destroyed
- Yuri's slave miner costs less and doesn't take as long to build
- Anti-ground machine guns have slightly shorter range
- Drones emitting gas have a slower rate of fire
- Fire by Magnetron has a slightly shorter range
- Guardian GI Warhead doesn't spread
- Psi Pulse affects allies
- Ore in general is more valuable

Other things I know are changed but couldn't see exactly:
- Superweapons are supposed to take longer to charge
